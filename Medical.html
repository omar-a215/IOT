            The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an application of the IoT for medical and health related purposes,
            data collection and analysis for research, and monitoring.[38][39][40][41][42] The IoMT has been referenced
            as "Smart Healthcare",[43] as the technology for creating a digitized healthcare system, connecting
            available medical resources and healthcare services.[44][45]

            IoT devices can be used to enable remote health monitoring and emergency notification systems. These health
            monitoring devices can range from blood pressure and heart rate monitors to advanced devices capable of
            monitoring specialized implants, such as pacemakers, Fitbit electronic wristbands, or advanced hearing
            aids.[46] Some hospitals have begun implementing "smart beds" that can detect when they are occupied and
            when a patient is attempting to get up. It can also adjust itself to ensure appropriate pressure and support
            is applied to the patient without the manual interaction of nurses.[38] A 2015 Goldman Sachs report
            indicated that healthcare IoT devices "can save the United States more than $300 billion in annual
            healthcare expenditures by increasing revenue and decreasing cost."[47] Moreover, the use of mobile devices
            to support medical follow-up led to the creation of 'm-health', used analyzed health statistics." [48]

            Specialized sensors can also be equipped within living spaces to monitor the health and general well-being
            of senior citizens, while also ensuring that proper treatment is being administered and assisting people
            regain lost mobility via therapy as well.[49] These sensors create a network of intelligent sensors that are
            able to collect, process, transfer, and analyze valuable information in different environments, such as
            connecting in-home monitoring devices to hospital-based systems.[43] Other consumer devices to encourage
            healthy living, such as connected scales or wearable heart monitors, are also a possibility with the
            IoT.[50] End-to-end health monitoring IoT platforms are also available for antenatal and chronic patients,
            helping one manage health vitals and recurring medication requirements.[51]

            Advances in plastic and fabric electronics fabrication methods have enabled ultra-low cost, use-and-throw
            IoMT sensors. These sensors, along with the required RFID electronics, can be fabricated on paper or
            e-textiles for wireless powered disposable sensing devices.[52] Applications have been established for
            point-of-care medical diagnostics, where portability and low system-complexity is essential.[53]

            As of 2018 IoMT was not only being applied in the clinical laboratory industry,[40] but also in the
            healthcare and health insurance industries. IoMT in the healthcare industry is now permitting doctors,
            patients, and others, such as guardians of patients, nurses, families, and similar, to be part of a system,
            where patient records are saved in a database, allowing doctors and the rest of the medical staff to have
            access to patient information.[54] Moreover, IoT-based systems are patient-centered, which involves being
            flexible to the patient's medical conditions.[citation needed] IoMT in the insurance industry provides
            access to better and new types of dynamic information. This includes sensor-based solutions such as
            biosensors, wearables, connected health devices, and mobile apps to track customer behavior. This can lead
            to more accurate underwriting and new pricing models.[55]

            The application of the IoT in healthcare plays a fundamental role in managing chronic diseases and in
            disease prevention and control. Remote monitoring is made possible through the connection of powerful
            wireless solutions. The connectivity enables health practitioners to capture patient's data and applying
            complex algorithms in health data analysis.
