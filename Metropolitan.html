            There are several planned or ongoing large-scale deployments of the IoT, to enable better management of
            cities and systems. For example, Songdo, South Korea, the first of its kind fully equipped and wired smart
            city, is gradually being built, with approximately 70 percent of the business district completed as of June
            2018. Much of the city is planned to be wired and automated, with little or no human intervention.[73][74]

            Another application is currently undergoing a project in Santander, Spain. For this deployment, two
            approaches have been adopted. This city of 180,000 inhabitants has already seen 18,000 downloads of its city
            smartphone app. The app is connected to 10,000 sensors that enable services like parking search,
            environmental monitoring, digital city agenda, and more. City context information is used in this deployment
            so as to benefit merchants through a spark deals mechanism based on city behavior that aims at maximizing
            the impact of each notification.[75]

            Other examples of large-scale deployments underway include the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City;[76]
            work on improving air and water quality, reducing noise pollution, and increasing transportation efficiency
            in San Jose, California;[77] and smart traffic management in western Singapore.[78] Using its RPMA (Random
            Phase Multiple Access) technology, San Diego-based Ingenu has built a nationwide public network[79] for
            low-bandwidth data transmissions using the same unlicensed 2.4 gigahertz spectrum as Wi-Fi. Ingenu's
            "Machine Network" covers more than a third of the US population across 35 major cities including San Diego
            and Dallas.[80] French company, Sigfox, commenced building an Ultra Narrowband wireless data network in the
            San Francisco Bay Area in 2014, the first business to achieve such a deployment in the U.S.[81][82] It
            subsequently announced it would set up a total of 4000 base stations to cover a total of 30 cities in the
            U.S. by the end of 2016, making it the largest IoT network coverage provider in the country thus
            far.[83][84] Cisco also participates in smart cities projects. Cisco has started deploying technologies for
            Smart Wi-Fi, Smart Safety & Security, Smart Lighting, Smart Parking, Smart Transports, Smart Bus Stops,
            Smart Kiosks, Remote Expert for Government Services (REGS) and Smart Education in the five km area in the
            city of Vijaywada.[85]

            Another example of a large deployment is the one completed by New York Waterways in New York City to connect
            all the city's vessels and be able to monitor them live 24/7. The network was designed and engineered by
            Fluidmesh Networks, a Chicago-based company developing wireless networks for critical applications. The NYWW
            network is currently providing coverage on the Hudson River, East River, and Upper New York Bay. With the
            wireless network in place, NY Waterway is able to take control of its fleet and passengers in a way that was
            not previously possible. New applications can include security, energy and fleet management, digital
            signage, public Wi-Fi, paperless ticketing and others.
