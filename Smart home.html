            A growing portion of IoT devices are created for consumer use, including connected vehicles, home
            automation, wearable technology, connected health, and appliances with remote monitoring capabilities.
            IoT devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation, which can include lighting, heating and air
            conditioning, media and security systems and camera systems.[25][26] Long-term benefits could include energy
            savings by automatically ensuring lights and electronics are turned off or by making the residents in the
            home aware of usage.[27]

            A smart home or automated home could be based on a platform or hubs that control smart devices and
            appliances.[28] For instance, using Apple's HomeKit, manufacturers can have their home products and
            accessories controlled by an application in iOS devices such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch.[29][30] This
            could be a dedicated app or iOS native applications such as Siri.[31] This can be demonstrated in the case
            of Lenovo's Smart Home Essentials, which is a line of smart home devices that are controlled through Apple's
            Home app or Siri without the need for a Wi-Fi bridge.[31] There are also dedicated smart home hubs that are
            offered as standalone platforms to connect different smart home products and these include the Amazon Echo,
            Google Home, Apple's HomePod, and Samsung's SmartThings Hub.[32] In addition to the commercial systems,
            there are many non-proprietary, open source ecosystems; including Home Assistant, OpenHAB and Domoticz.
            One key application of a smart home is to provide assistance for those with disabilities and elderly
            individuals. These home systems use assistive technology to accommodate an owner's specific
            disabilities.[35] Voice control can assist users with sight and mobility limitations while alert systems can
            be connected directly to cochlear implants worn by hearing-impaired users.[36] They can also be equipped
            with additional safety features. These features can include sensors that monitor for medical emergencies
            such as falls or seizures.[37] Smart home technology applied in this way can provide users with more freedom
            and a higher quality of life.[35]

            The term "Enterprise IoT" refers to devices used in business and corporate settings. By 2019, it is
            estimated that the EIoT will account for 9.1 billion devices.
